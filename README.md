# Duskmourn, House of Horror

Welcome to Duskmourn, a house steeped in pain and fear, driven by the unrelenting hunger of its demonic ruler. The House is an endless trap of malevolence with a single goal: to keep survivors trapped within its walls in an infinite loop of terror and fear. Every shadow hides monsters, and every breeze whispers the promise of a fate worse than death. The rooms inside the house are constantly moving and shifting, making it very difficult to traverse through it and find the exit. Within its endlessly shifting halls, survivors desperately try to stay alive against a house full of entities all intent on destroying or devouring them. Duskmourn is ruled by Valgavoth, an elder demon entity who seeks to feed on the fear of those who enter the house.

## Rooms

The game features five rooms that you'll explore in a random order:

The Mistmoors: The Mistmoors is full of vast, echoing spaces that unsettle and unnerve. Rooms in this zone are typically characterized by white stone architecture, billowing drapes, drifts of windblown sand, and flat gray skies with no visible sun. 

The Floodpits: The Floodpits is home to the most physics-defying environments of the House, full of surreal passages and impossible architectural juxtapositions. Rooms in this zone tend to feature water in some form—liquid, solid, or gas—as well as water stains and wall-spanning banks of staticky screens.

The Balemurk: Dimly lit and ominous, the Balemurk is filled with shadows deeper than they seem like they should be and unsettlingly organic shapes and substances. Jagged crevasses and rotted floorboards dominate, along with septic marshes and withered flora.

The Boilerbilges:The Boilerbilges is characterized by the most overtly treacherous terrain in the House, full of precipitous drops, jagged architecture, and belching flames. It's also prone to violent, destructive events, like earthquakes and fire twisters, making survival in this zone an even less likely prospect than normal.

The Hauntwoods: Out of all the zones, the Hauntwoods is where the line between inside- and outside-seeming environments is most blurred, as trees, plants, and other vegetation invade dining rooms and corridors and even act as support beams for ceilings lost somewhere amongst the canopy. In some cases, plants appear to be decaying the structure of the House itself through voracious, unrestrained growth.

Each room contains an enemy or puzzle that must be defeated or completed before progressing.

## Combat

Combat is turn-based. On your turn, you can:

1. Attack
2. Use your special ability
3. Use a health potion (if available)

Defeat all enemies and solve all puzzles to clear the room and progress throug the house until you reach The Devouring Father himself, Valgavoth.
